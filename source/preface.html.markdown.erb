# Xin Ch√†o!

This book is based on my work at [SupportBee](https://supportbee.com). I started writing code for SupportBee's single page frontend using Backbone.js in early 2011. At that time, I was new to Good Javascript and ofcourse Single Page Apps. I am hoping to show you what I have learnt over the last few years and hear your thoughts on my approach to building single page webapps. The book (just like SupportBee and everything else I do) is a work in progress and I'll be adding more chapters over time. 

This is my first book and your feedback will make it better. Please send me your feedback/thoughts via [email](prateek@supportbee.com) or reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/prateekdayal). You can also add a comment on any page on this site (including this one!). I look forward to hearing from you!
